# OnTrack Dashboard — Gestores do Futuro Project (ESPRO)

This repository presents the dashboard developed as part of the **Gestores do Futuro** program, promoted by **ESPRO (Ensino Social Profissionalizante)**. The project was carried out within the context of the fictional company **OnTrack**, created by the students with the goal of connecting young audiences to relevant news in a fun and accessible way.

## 📊 About the Dashboard

The dashboard was built using **Power BI** and aims to monitor the performance of our class throughout the semester, focusing on three main areas:

### 1. Events (Project Management)
- Evaluation of classroom events based on **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**.
- Identification of the most appreciated events and those needing improvement.
- Analysis by event type and completion rate.

### 2. Marketing (Instagram Insights)
- Analysis of **engagement** and **reach** by sector and content type.
- Identification of **peak performance days** during the week.
- Monitoring of **view rate** to understand how the Instagram algorithm delivers content.
- Tracking of **follower growth** over time.

### 3. Human Resources (HR)
- Monitoring of **absences and delays** by sector and month.
- Identification of behavioral patterns and seasonal trends.

## ⚙️ Development Process

The dashboard was built through a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process:
- Data extraction from forms, spreadsheets, and Instagram Insights.
- Cleaning and standardization of information.
- Data modeling and visualization in Power BI.

## 💡 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply:
- Business Intelligence and data visualization concepts.
- Real-world data organization and structuring.
- Creation of meaningful indicators and metrics.
- Clear and accessible communication of insights.
